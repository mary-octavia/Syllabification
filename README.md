Syllabification
===============

These are two non-optimized, quick and dirty, algorithms for syllabifying 
Romanian words written orthographically (and not in IPA).

ortho_syllabify.py 
- follows the end-of-the-line hyphenation rules listed in DOOM3
- can be quickly tested here: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user5-Sx4RXVO6ROjUMze-7.py

syllabify.py 
- follows MOP and Ioana Chitoran's constraint based approach to Romanian Phonology
- can be quickly tested here: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user5-AN4aaEbwtq49Ar4-18.py
